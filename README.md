## What is Chatkit?

[Chatkit](https://pusher.com/chatkit?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=build-a-slack-clone-with-react-and-pusher-chatkit) is a hosted API that helps you build impressive chat features into your applications with less code. Features like,

* Group chat
* One-to-one chat
* Private chat
* Typing indicators
* "Who's online" presence
* Read receipts
* Photo, video, and audio messages

Using our cross-platform SDKs, all chat data is sent to our hosted API where we manage chat state and broadcast it to your clients:
